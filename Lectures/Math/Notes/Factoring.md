 $$3x²+21x+30$$
  take the gcf


since the coefficients are all multiples of 3 we can devide by 3

$$\frac{3x^{2}}{3}+\frac{21x}{3} \frac{30}{3}$$
$$x²+7x+10$$

find to numbers that multiplies to 10 but adds 7, which is 5 and 2

$$5\cdot 2 = 10$$
$$5+2=7$$

therefore we get:


$$3\cdot(x+5)\cdot(x+2)$$


let's try this:

$$x²+5x+6$$
Find number that multiplies to 6 but adds to 5 which is 3 and 2

$$3\cdot2=6$$
$$3+2=5$$

therefore we get:


$$(x+2)\cdot(x+3)$$
